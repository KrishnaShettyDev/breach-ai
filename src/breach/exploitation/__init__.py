"""
BREACH.AI - Shannon-Style Exploitation Validation
===================================================

Proof-by-Exploitation: Only report vulnerabilities that can be successfully exploited.
Based on Shannon's approach - if we can't exploit it, we don't report it.

Components:
- ExploitationValidator: Browser-based exploit validation
- OWASPAgents: Parallel specialized agents for each vulnerability category
- SourceAnalyzer: Data flow analysis for white-box testing
- PoCGenerator: Reproducible proof-of-concept generation
- EvidenceCollector: Screenshots, DOM snapshots, network traces
